In terms of putting a selling price, most people will try to get the highest possible price, so it should be a skew gaussian.
In terms of defining a buy price, most people will try to be at the lowest, hoever it should match the selling prices, so putting it too low, there's a risk of not having a seller.

Now it should try to match a buy price and with a selling price. The seller has the upper hand as it can only be sold at his defined price. As it is hard to
find the exact same buying price, it is better to just find a stocks in a range around your buying price. The closer it is the higher the chance of acutally buying

So set buy price, define a range, compare found stock price with original buy price and find the match probability
